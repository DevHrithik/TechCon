TechCon: Your Hub for Upcoming Tech Conferences

TechCon stands as a dedicated platform that compiles a comprehensive list of imminent tech conferences. This website serves as an integral component of a recruitment assignment for the esteemed role of GDSC JU Dev Core Member.

Harnessing the fundamental building blocks of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I have crafted this dynamic website. The backbone of TechCon is an API graciously provided by GDSC JU, which furnishes a wealth of data in JSON format. Through adept manipulation and parsing, this data seamlessly transforms into an interactive HTML table, thoughtfully adorned with customization via basic CSS and Bootstrap.

While my aspirations lie in the realm of becoming a DevOps Engineer, embarking on the TechCon project has proven immensely enjoyable and intellectually stimulating. It has been an opportunity for me to immerse myself in the intricacies of JSON and API integration, adding a diverse skill set to my repertoire.

I extend a warm invitation to explore this simple yet impactful website, which you can access by simply {clicking here]. Dive into the world of upcoming tech conferences, experience the elegant synergy of code and design, and join me on this exciting journey of learning and innovation.
